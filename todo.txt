2d projection (I think):
    1. Take two points on the plane
    2. Make a vector
    3. Normalize the little shit
    4. Crossproduct it with the normal vector
    5. Vectors from step 3 and 4 are now unit vectors
    6. Put two unit vectors into a 3x2 matrix 
    7. Multiply it by the target point
    8. Get 2D coordinates of said point
